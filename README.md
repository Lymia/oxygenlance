Oxygenlance is a modified version of [gearlance], an interpreter for [BF Joust]. It is designed to be embedded in a larger Rust program, and operate entirely in memory (instead of requiring launching and communicating with a separate process). It has further modifications to intergrate better into a Rust ecosystem, as well as be able to function in a threaded environment.
