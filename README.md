# Oxygenlance

Oxygenlance is a modified version of [gearlance](https://github.com/fis/chainlance), an interpreter for [BF Joust](http://esolangs.org/wiki/BF_Joust). It is designed to be embedded in a larger Rust program, and operate entirely in memory (instead of requiring launching and communicating with a separate process). It has further modifications to intergrate better into a Rust ecosystem, as well as be able to function in a threaded environment.
